    base_prompt_content = """You are an expert AI assistant in the field of NLP and professional skills examiner. Your task is to categorize a question based on a predefined set of skills.
        Your response MUST STRICTLY follow these rules:
        1.  Carefully analyze the "Question to analyze" below and its corresponding "Skill Preconception".
        2.  From the "Valid Skills" and said skill's corresponding example from the "Example Skills" lists (only for the lists provided), select **at least 1, but not more than 4** "perceptual_skill" and **at least 1, but not more than 4** "reasoning_skill" that are most relevant.
        3.  Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with the keys "perceptual_skills" and "reasoning_skills", with each key containing at least one skill per category.

        **Valid Perceptual Skills:**
        {perceptual_skills_str}

        **Valid Reasoning Skills:**
        {reasoning_skills_str}

        ---
        **Question to analyze:**
        {question}
        {choices}
        ---

        Provide the required skills for the question above. Your response must be a single JSON object with the keys "perceptual_skills" and "reasoning_skills".

        E.g. two valid responses for a question requiring both types of skills:
        ```json
        {{
            "perceptual_skills": ["'Prosody Detection', "],
            "reasoning_skills": ["'Speaker Intent', 'Pragmatics and Causal Reasoning'"]
        }},
        {{
            "perceptual_skills": ["'Paralinguistic/Emotion Recognition', 'Lexical and Phrase-Level Recognition'"],
            "reasoning_skills": ["'Social Role and Relationship Inference', 'Logical/Consistency Reasoning'"]
        }}
        ```
        """
